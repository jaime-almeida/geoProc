# geoProc Library 

This contains the source code for the processing module geoProc, developed during my PhD thesis.

To install it, use pip to install the *.whl file present in the dist folder.

Most features  are commented and should be easy to follow. Any questions please contact me at jealmeida@fc.ul.pt
